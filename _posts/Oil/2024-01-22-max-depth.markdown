I've changed `max_depth` parameter, range from 3 to 13.

To be brief, as same with [the penalization parameters](/oil%20price%20forecasting/about-penalization), the `max_depth` parameter were effective for `default XGBoost` but not for the `XGBoost with random forest`.<br>

I attached the RMSE graph in each case below.<br>

## 1. Max depth
<br>
**[`max_depth` ranges from 3 to 13]**

**1. Default XGBoost**
{% include oil_plotly/RMSE_of_BT_max_depth_change.html %}

<br>
**2. XGBoost with Random Forest**
{% include oil_plotly/RMSE_of_BTRF_max_depth_change.html %}
<br>
The below plot is the mean of RMSE for the whole test period.
